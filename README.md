## Introduction
This project explores the relationship between city rankings, happiness levels, and health metrics such as obesity and life expectancy. It aims to uncover patterns and insights that can guide urban planning and public health initiatives.

## About the Dataset
Key Features and Relationships:
1.  Rank vs. Happiness Levels:
- Explore how city rankings (e.g., economic or social rankings) correlate with overall happiness scores.
- Consider using data such as GDP per capita, unemployment rates, or other social metrics to enrich your analysis.
2.  Obesity Levels vs. Life Expectancy:
- Investigate the relationship between obesity prevalence and its impact on average life expectancy.
- Identify trends across different regions or demographics to uncover patterns in health disparities.
3.  Relationships:
  - Rank vs. Happiness: Examine how societal factors, such as access to education or healthcare, affect happiness rankings. Use scatterplots or regression models to visualize correlations.
  - Obesity Levels vs. Life Expectancy: Apply correlation analysis to quantify the strength of this relationship. A negative correlation might indicate the health impact of higher obesity rates.
    
Modeling for Predictions
- Combine the above features (e.g., rank, happiness, obesity levels, life expectancy) to build a predictive model.
- Use machine learning techniques like regression analysis or classification models to predict overall quality of life and health outcomes.

## Questions Answered on city rankings and health metrics:
1.  Are higher-ranked cities consistently happier?
2.  What impact do rising obesity rates have on average life expectancy across different cities?
3.  What combination of factors (e.g., rank, happiness, obesity rates) best predicts overall quality of life?
4.  Do cities in certain regions consistently perform better or worse in these metrics?

5.  What interventions could cities prioritize to improve quality of life and health outcomes?

## Data Wrangling
To ensure our data is in the best form for analysis, removed currency symbols and percentages, converting relevant columns to float.
