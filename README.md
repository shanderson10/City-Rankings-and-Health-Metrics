# Project 5: Health Analytics

## Overview

This project applies data analysis techniques to a health-related dataset. The focus is on using statistical methods and Python programming to explore health indicators, identify potential correlations, and visualize patterns within the data.

*(Note: The specific dataset and research questions are detailed within the assets).*

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical tests and models (e.g., correlation analysis, regression, hypothesis testing - depending on project specifics) to health data.
* **Python Programming:** Using Python for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
    * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the health dataset to understand distributions, relationships, and potential outliers.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating informative plots and charts to communicate health data insights.
* **Data Interpretation:** Drawing meaningful conclusions from the analysis of health data.

## Tools Used

* **Python:** For data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
* **Google Colab:** As the likely development environment for the Python analysis. *(Note: The provided asset link is for a presentation, not the Colab notebook itself).*
* **Microsoft PowerPoint / Google Slides:** For summarizing the analysis methodology, findings, and visualizations.

## Project Assets

* **Presentation (Summarizing Analysis & Findings):** [View Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BVXbXP23dochzzMQwF9T5bd8ilAHdZPj/edit?usp=sharing) (Requires Google account access)
    * *(Ideally, add a link to the Google Colab notebook containing the Python code if available).*

## How to Use

1.  Access the presentation via the link above to understand the project's objectives, methodology, key statistical findings, and visualizations related to the health data. You will need to be signed in to your Google account.
2.  *(If Colab notebook link is added):* Access the Google Colab notebook to view and run the Python code used for the analysis.
